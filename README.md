<h1>Case Study :</h1>
In old aged homes, the relatives of the people are not updated about their parents as frequently as required. No one is aware about their condition in old aged homes.There is no doctor services available neither any diet plans. It is a not so good situation in there.
<h1>What makes us different : </h1>
Our web app has some differentiating features such as video chat between relative and the old aged as well as text chat between the admin and the relative. Every old aged has a unique token, so any random person cannot access details.
<h1>Description : Neko Old Age Home </h1>
